### I. Seting up the Rasberry Pi, headlessly. 
In order to set up a Rasberry Pi to be able to work on it, an operating system must be installed.   
There are a variety of [OS](https://www.fossmint.com/operating-systems-for-raspberry-pi/) that can be used to interact with your Rasberry Pi, but we ended up using the one mentioned in the article, [Rasbpian Jessie Lite](http://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian_lite/images/raspbian_lite-2016-09-28/), because of its small size and because we were not in need of a GUI. 

The following project is inspired by following [article](https://learn.adafruit.com/digital-free-library/).

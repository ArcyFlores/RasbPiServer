## About 
This project goes over how to set up your own Rasberry Pi as a cloud server and wireless access point.   
We use the commands laid out in the [setup_rasp_pi](https://github.ccs.neu.edu/aflores/cs5700/blob/master/setup_rasp_pi) to setup the raspbi. These instructions go over DHCP, NAT translation, Static IP addressing, and wireless access point set up.     
Then the code laid out in the src directory is a small Django web application that utilizes Bootstrap to allow a user to upload files directly onto the RasberryPi, making the RasbpPi a fully functioning Web Server that serves HTTP requests to the user to display HTML pages and other media. 

### Getting started
| Hardware   | Software      | 
| -------------- |:---------:| 
| Ethernet Cable | PuTTY     |
| Rasberry Pi    | Etcher    |
| MicroSD card   |           |
| Micro USB cable|


### I. Seting up the Rasberry Pi, headlessly. 
In order to set up a Rasberry Pi to be able to work on it, an operating system must be installed.   
There are a variety of [OS](https://www.fossmint.com/operating-systems-for-raspberry-pi/) that can be used to interact with your Rasberry Pi, but we ended up using the one mentioned in the article, [Rasbpian Jessie Lite](http://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian_lite/images/raspbian_lite-2016-09-28/), because of its small size and because we were not in need of a GUI. 

### II. Installing Apache

### III. Configure Access Point

### IV. Running Code
